# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

llm-chat-rag is a command-line interface (CLI) chatbot application that leverages OpenAI's 4o-mini Large Language Model (LLM) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using ChromaDB to provide accurate, context-aware responses to user questions. By combining the power of modern LLMs with document retrieval capabilities, this application aims to deliver more factual and contextually relevant answers.

## 2. Product Vision

### 2.1 Problem Statement
Traditional chatbots often provide responses based solely on their training data, which may result in:
- Outdated information
- "Hallucinations" (fabricated information)
- Inability to access specific knowledge bases
- Lack of context awareness for domain-specific questions

### 2.2 Solution Overview
llm-chat-rag addresses these limitations by:
- Implementing RAG to retrieve relevant documents before generating responses
- Using ChromaDB as a vector database to store and efficiently search document embeddings
- Leveraging OpenAI's 4o-mini model to generate high-quality responses based on retrieved context
- Providing a simple CLI interface for easy interaction

## 3. Target Users

- Developers seeking to experiment with RAG capabilities
- Researchers who need quick access to information in their document collections
- Knowledge workers who want to query their personal or organizational knowledge bases
- Technical teams requiring an internal tool for accessing documentation or knowledge repositories

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1 Command-Line Interface
- Simple, text-based interface
- Easy-to-use commands for interaction
- History navigation
- Session management

### 4.2 Document Ingestion
- Support for multiple document formats (PDF, TXT, MD, etc.)
- Document chunking and preprocessing
- Embedding generation and storage in ChromaDB
- Incremental updates to the knowledge base

### 4.3 RAG Implementation
- Semantic search using ChromaDB
- Relevance-based document retrieval
- Context assembly for the LLM prompt
- Citation tracking back to source documents

### 4.4 Response Generation
- Integration with OpenAI's 4o-mini model
- Context-enhanced prompting
- Response post-processing and formatting
- Confidence scoring for answers

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Dependencies
- Python 3.11
- Aready populated ChromaDB for vector storage and retrieval
- OpenAI API client library
- Document processing libraries (depending on supported formats)
- Embedding models/libraries

### 5.2 System Architecture
- Document processor module
- Vector database manager (ChromaDB integration)
- Retrieval engine
- LLM interface (OpenAI API)
- CLI application layer

### 5.3 Performance Requirements
- Response time < 5 seconds for standard queries (dependent on OpenAI API response time)
- Support for knowledge bases up to 100MB of text
- Efficient memory usage suitable for standard personal computers

## 6. User Experience

### 6.1 Command-Line Interface
- Clear, concise prompts and responses
- Visual distinction between system messages and AI responses
- Simple commands for common actions (help, quit, reset context, etc.)
- Error handling with clear error messages

### 6.2 Example Interactions
- Initial setup and document ingestion
- Simple Q&A with the system
- Follow-up questions maintaining context
- System providing sources/citations for information

## 7. Implementation Phases

### 7.1 Phase 1: MVP
- Basic CLI interface
- Integration with OpenAI's 4o-mini
- Simple document ingestion (text files only)
- Basic RAG implementation with ChromaDB

### 7.2 Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Support for multiple document formats
- Improved chunking and preprocessing strategies
- Conversation history and context management
- Performance optimization

### 7.3 Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Fine-tuning options for the retrieval mechanism
- Support for custom embedding models
- Extended metadata for better search relevance
- Batch processing for large document collections

## 8. Success Metrics

- Response accuracy compared to traditional (non-RAG) approach
- Response time and system performance
- User satisfaction with relevance of answers
- Reduction in hallucinations or factually incorrect responses

## 9. Limitations and Constraints

- Dependent on OpenAI API availability and rate limits
- Limited to text-based knowledge (no image or audio understanding)
- Performance constraints based on ChromaDB scaling capabilities
- Requires proper document preprocessing for optimal results

## 10. Future Considerations

- Web interface or API endpoint
- Support for multimodal content
- Integration with additional LLM providers
- Collaborative features for team knowledge bases
- Automated knowledge base updates from external sources
